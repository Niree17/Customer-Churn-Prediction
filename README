# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview

Customer churn prediction is a machine learning project aimed at identifying customers who are likely to stop using a service. By analyzing historical data, businesses can take proactive measures to retain customers and improve overall satisfaction.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training using machine learning algorithms
- Evaluation and performance metrics
- Deployment (if applicable)

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy (Data Processing)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
- TensorFlow/Keras (Deep Learning, if applicable)
- Google Colab (for execution)

## Dataset

The dataset used contains customer details, usage history, and churn labels. Common columns include:

- **Customer ID**
- **Subscription Length**
- **Monthly Charges**
- **Total Charges**
- **Contract Type**
- **Payment Method**
- **Churn (Yes/No)**

## Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Understanding data distribution
   - Identifying key churn indicators
3. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   - Using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Neural Networks
   - Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
4. **Deployment (Optional)**
   - Deploying the model using Flask or Streamlit

## Results

The model achieves an accuracy of approximately **X%** (depending on the dataset and model used). The insights gained can help businesses reduce churn rates by targeting at-risk customers with personalized retention strategies.

## Future Improvements

- Use deep learning models for better accuracy
- Incorporate additional customer behavior metrics
- Deploy the model as a web service
