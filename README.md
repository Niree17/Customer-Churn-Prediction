#  Customer Churn Prediction using ANN & TensorFlow

##  **Overview**  
This project predicts **customer churn** (whether a customer will leave a service) using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** built with **TensorFlow and Keras**.  

**Business Use Case**: Helps companies **identify at-risk customers** and take action to **reduce churn**.  
**Dataset**: A structured dataset containing customer demographics, subscription details, and churn labels.  
**Technology Stack**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn.

##  Features  
**Data Preprocessing** – Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and normalizes data.  
**Feature Engineering** – Selects the most important factors influencing churn.  
**ANN Model** – A fully connected neural network trained to predict churn probability.  
**Evaluation Metrics** – Uses accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
**Deployable Model** – Can be integrated into a Flask API for real-world use.
